### Usage

These are *==personal==* scripts so I do not guarantee they will work on your system or that they won't blow everything up, but I do try to make them as clean as possible so I don't mess any of my stuff up, so you should be safe.

### Current Scripts

This is a list of my current scripts for both Linux and Windows. for Linux scripts it'll say what distro(s) I tested them on, but they should all mostly work as long as the same pack manager is being used.

#### Linux

- Ubun2Media Server(insert link) - tested on Ubuntu

#### Windows

- Coming Soon..
