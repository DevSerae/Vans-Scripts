### Usage

These are *personal* scripts so I do not guarantee they will work on your system or that they won't blow everything up, but I do try to make them as clean as possible so I don't mess any of my stuff up, so you should be safe.

### Windows Scripts

#### SymLink Creator

This is a script used for creating symlinks via a lightweight GUI easily. I found that Windows is lacking in the creation of proper SymLinks so I made this script to make it a bit easier

##### Installation

Download the Symlink_Creator.ps1 file and run it, no extra dependencies required everything it needs is in the .ps1 file.

#### Personal $PROFILE

This is just my personal $PROFILE with my aliases and modules, nothing special.

#### Personal settings.json

Contains my favourite themes and colour schemes.

#### AutoHotkey Scripts

- Copilot rebind to Flow Launcher script
- Alt+Tab rebind to Win+Tab script

### Linux Scripts

#### Ubun2MediaServer

WIP! Do not use this script yet it is still under development.
